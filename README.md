# WHO_Gov_Spending
An Excel based project camparing government spending on maternal health with data sourced from the World Health Organization. Special Attention was given to data cleaning, transformation, and Exploratory Analysis. 


# Data Exploration & Cleaning


## Data Acquisition

The data used in this analysis was downloaded from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database on December 4th, 2023. [WHO Data Platform](https://platform.who.int/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing)


## Data Cleaning & Transformation

Data cleaning was limited too adjusting formatting and filtering data. Instances of null values were not included in visualizations or calculations.  

The original data set included the numeric data-- the percent of spending in each category-- in 2 formats  labeled "Value Numeric"  and  "Value String" which is formatted as numeric data and a string being the numeric value rounded to the nearest whole number.  During the data exploration phase, an additional column was created to portray the numeric data as a percentage for ease of interpretation. ("Value Percent")

A pivot table was then made to group countries spending data. The original data separated each country's spending by the source of funding; government, private, and external aid. Bar graphs created from this pivot table are included ___HERE_____.


## Exploratory Analysis
*Questions used to drive analysis were as follows:*</br>
- Is there a correlation between the percentage of health care spending on reproductive health and maternal conditions?</br>
- Is there a correlation between the percentage of health care spending on contraceptive and maternal conditions?</br>
- which countries spend the most on contraceptive, reproductive, and maternal health conditions as a percentage of their health care spending?</br>
- Are countries more likely to spend more in these areas based on their region (as classified by WHO region)? </br>

## Limitations
The scope of the data set analyzed does not allow us to make concrete conclusions about whether spending in contraceptive and reproductive health reduces spending on maternal condition. External factors like each country's GDP and budget in terms of an international currency would aid in presenting the data to the lay person. 

Furthermore, the percent of the budget used does not attest to the efficiency of the money spent. More efficient health care systems can reduce costs, thus allowing a smaller budget to assist more patients.
